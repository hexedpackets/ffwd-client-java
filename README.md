# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This repo is no longer actively maintained. While it should continue to work and there are no major known bugs, we will not be improving ffwd or releasing new versions.

# A java client to FastForward

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/spotify/ffwd-client-java.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/spotify/ffwd-client-java)

A java client for the native protobuf protocol of [ffwd](https://github.com/spotify/ffwd).

## Usage

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.spotify.ffwd</groupId>
    <artifactId>ffwd-client</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST-VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
public class Foo {
    private static final FastForward ffwd = FastForward.setup();
    private static final Metric metric = FastForward.metric("foo.metric").attribute("class", Foo.class.getCanonicalName());

    public void run() throws IOException {
        ffwd.send(metric.value(42));
    }
}
```

## OpenCensus Exporter

All registered OpenCensus Stats views will be exported to FFWD.

At this time histograms/distributions are not supported in Heroic until [#476](https://github.com/spotify/heroic/issues/476) is resolved.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.spotify.ffwd</groupId>
    <artifactId>opencensus-exporter</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST-VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
com.spotify.ffwd.FfwdStatsExporter.createAndRegister(
   com.spotify.ffwd.FfwdStatsConfiguration.builder().setExporterIntervalSeconds(30).build()
);
```
